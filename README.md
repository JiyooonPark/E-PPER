Trying to cram for the E-PPER test

Started on 2020-10-03

Test takes place on 2020-10-10

for anyone who came to this repo while searching for E-PPER resources, here are my tips

1. Take them as soon as possible and as often as possible. 
  There are several reasons why I suggest you to take them in this manner, but the biggest one is that it does not matter how many times you took them. You just need to pass ONE!
2. Look carefully at the previous test questions
  at least 2 questions of 8 are questions from the previous years. I suggest you to look at at least two years worth of test questions.
3. Listen to the E-PPER tutoring sessions
  the tutors there are really good at optimizing the questions. Even if you know how to solve the question, they give you tips on how to improve your code.
4. Choose the right language. 
  I chose java because I am really bad at C and C seems more complex. But there were questions on the test that were easier to solve with C. So choose whichever one you feel more comfortable with. But java has a lot of libraries.... (java is strongly recommended)

I didn't pass the test with the best results but compared to how much effort I put into preperation for the exam, my results were not bad at all

I wish you best of luck on yours! :)
